## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

**How to Report a Vulnerability:**

1.  **Do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
2.  Please report vulnerabilities by creating a **confidential issue** if your GitHub plan and repository settings support this feature for public repositories.
3.  Alternatively, if confidential issues are not available or you are unsure, please email the repository owner directly (if a contact email is listed in the repository or user profile).
4.  If direct private reporting is not immediately clear or available, you may create a regular GitHub issue but please title it clearly as "Security Vulnerability Report - [Brief Description]" and avoid including full exploit details in the initial public report. We will then contact you for more details privately.

**What to Include in Your Report:**

Please include the following details in your report:

*   A clear description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any specific URLs, parameters, or configurations.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots, if applicable.

**Our Commitment:**

*   We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48-72 hours.
*   We will investigate the reported vulnerability and aim to provide an update on our findings within 7-10 business days.
*   We will work to remediate accepted vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
*   We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.
*   We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it.

We appreciate your efforts to keep RDA Tracker secure.
